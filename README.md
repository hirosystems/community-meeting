## Purpose

At Hiro, we operate on a "developers first" principle. We deeply care for and empathize with your desire to be productive when building projects on Stacks blockchain. 

The monthly Hiro Developer meeting is an open communication channel between the Hiro product teams and the developers building on Stacks using the Hiro tools. We want to bring visibility into critical product updates, elevate community use-cases, and promote an open feedback forum in these monthly meetings.

We are open to suggestions and may course-correct the agenda/format of these meetings to better support you on your development journey.
