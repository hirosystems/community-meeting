## Purpose

Internally at Hiro, we operate on a "developers first" principle. We deeply care for and empathize with your desire to be productive when building projects on Stacks blockchain. 

The monthly Hiro Developer meeting intends to provide an open communication channel between the Hiro product teams and the developers building on Stacks using the Hiro tools. We want to bring visibility into critical product updates, elevate community use-cases and activities, and promote an open feedback forum in these monthly meetings.

Lastly, the Hiro team is starting with the goal of establishing this live developer community collaboration. We will be in an active listening mode; incrementally, we may course-correct the agenda/format of this conversation to better support you on your development journey.
